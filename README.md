# A/B Testing Analysis
This repository contains an A/B testing analysis project aimed at evaluating the impact of a change or intervention. The analysis uses statistical techniques to draw actionable insights from the test results.

## Project Overview
A/B testing is a method used to compare two versions of a webpage or product to determine which one performs better. This project involves designing and conducting an A/B test, analyzing the results, and providing insights based on statistical analysis.

## Methodology
- Test Setup: Define the hypothesis, choose the metrics to measure, and set up the control and variation groups.
- Data Collection: Collect data from the A/B test over a specified period.
- Data Analysis: Calculate key metrics for both groups. Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests) to determine the significance of the results.
- Visualization: Create plots and charts to visualize the test results.
- Insights and Recommendations: Interpret the results and provide actionable recommendations based on the findings.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository
- Install required packages
- Run the 'AB Testing Analysis.ipynb' to perform the A/B test analysis.
